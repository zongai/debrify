/// guide answers locally and instantly — the common case, and no network is
/// involved for it at all). Only a channel with no local answer needs a
/// per-stream request, and those are deliberately rationed:
///
/// - **Dwell gate.** A row must stay mounted [_fetchDwell] before it asks
///   for anything, so channels flying past under a scroll never queue work
///   (their timer dies with them).
/// - **Politeness budget.** At most [_maxConcurrentRowFetches] rows may have
///   a request outstanding at once, app-wide. A row that finds the budget
///   full re-arms instead of queuing, so a screenful fills in progressively
///   rather than firing two dozen requests the instant scrolling stops.
///
/// Both exist because a big Xtream list has no XMLTV fallback to lean on:
/// without rationing, browsing a 50k-channel guide would fire one
/// `get_short_epg` per channel seen — enough to jank the UI decoding replies
/// and enough for a panel to rate-limit the account.
