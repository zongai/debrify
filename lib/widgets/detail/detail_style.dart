/// Blueprint's 32px rule and the film grain some themes ask for.

/// Both are whole-page textures, so they are applied once at the body root
/// rather than by each layout. Grain is a foreground layer and is forced off on
/// TV by [DetailTheme.grainFor] — a per-frame blend over a full screen is not
/// something a 2 GB box should be asked to do.
///
/// ## The app-wide texture owns the page; this is the fallback
///
/// `AppTexture` (theme/app_texture.dart) paints the same two textures for the
/// whole app, above the root Navigator. Without a rule, a details page under a
/// grain theme would be grained TWICE — once by the shell and once here —
/// doubling the speck density and, on Blueprint, drawing the rule over itself.
///
/// The rule is: **whenever the APP theme declares a texture, it owns every
/// page, including this one**, and this widget stands down. When the app theme
/// declares none — which includes legacy, and is the common case — the details
/// page's own `detail_theme` texture paints here as it always has.
///
/// The consequence worth stating: a user on app-theme Blueprint and
/// detail-theme Sepia sees Blueprint's grid on the details page, not Sepia's
/// grain. That is deliberate. Grain and grid are properties of the PAGE, not
/// of a palette, and two whole-page textures fighting over one page is worse
/// than either of them winning. The details theme still owns everything else
/// it always did — its palette, geometry and type are untouched by this.
///
/// ## Both painters are the batched ones
///
/// The originals issued up to 3,000 `drawRect` calls per repaint. They now
/// come from `app_texture.dart`, which computes the speck field once into a
/// reused buffer and emits it as a single `drawRawPoints`.
