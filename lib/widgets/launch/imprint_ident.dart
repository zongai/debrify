/// Imprint — the wordmark is never drawn. It is blind-debossed into uncoated
/// board, and a single warm light rakes across the sheet and finds it.
///
/// The relief is the whole ident, and it is built from three flat text passes
/// per letter rather than from any blur: a shadow wall, a lit wall, and the
/// pressed face that sits between them. A deboss is a VALLEY — the wall on the
/// light's side turns away from it and goes to shadow, and the far wall is the
/// one that catches it. Reversed, this reads as a 2003 bevel-and-emboss, which
/// is the single thing that separates this from looking cheap.
///
/// TV notes: the board (its gradient, its tooth and its vignette) is entirely
/// static, so it lives in the [backdrop] and rasters once — the tooth is
/// thousands of flecks and would be unaffordable per tick, but it is what
/// separates "uncoated stock" from "dark rectangle". The light is ONE radial
/// shader baked into a unit rect and stretched by the canvas, so nothing
/// native is created per frame. Per-letter relief strength goes through
/// [IdentAlphaSets] (quantized, pre-baked) — never a per-frame alpha on text.
///
/// Timeline: .02–.82 the light crosses the sheet, easeInOut so the rake is
/// held long enough to read · relief exists only where the light has been, and
/// stays behind it (the press does not un-press) · the light coasts to a dead
/// stop just right of centre, and the frame is motionless from there.
