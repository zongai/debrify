/// Trace — a signal locking on. One point of light runs the frame, drawing a
/// hairline rule as it goes, and the letters it passes over ignite in its wake
/// and cool to a steady glow. When the light reaches the end it flares out and
/// the rule retracts to a single centred tick under the name.
///
/// The material is light itself rather than a colour: the pulse is white, its
/// halo is barely blue, and the type is platinum. That is what keeps it from
/// being Monogram's ring redrawn horizontally — here the type is a filament the
/// pulse lights, not a caption that fades up underneath a mark.
///
/// **The cadence is normalised against the WORDMARK, never the frame.** The
/// rule's length is derived from the laid-out word (16% wider), the dot travels
/// that rule, and each letter's ignition is keyed to the dot's *x* crossing it —
/// a spatial ramp, not a per-letter time offset. So the seven letters occupy the
/// same ~82% of the travel on a 21:9 panel, a 16:9 TV and a portrait phone, and
/// no easing exponent has to be retuned per aspect ratio. (Collider learned this
/// the expensive way: normalised against the screen diagonal, its lockup was 11%
/// of the wave's travel and every letter lit at once.)
///
/// TV notes: near the cost floor. Per tick this is three [Canvas.drawLine]s,
/// six circles while the pulse is alive (the five-step `_kHalo` falloff plus
/// its white core — see the comment there for why two steps is not enough on a
/// bright point), none once it has flared out, and one text draw per settled
/// letter — two only for the ~250 ms a letter is igniting. No saveLayer, no
/// shaders, no per-frame native allocation; the only blur is the dot's halo on
/// the phone/desktop path, and it is the disc ladder that replaces it on TV.
/// The ground is a static gradient and rasters once in [backdrop].
///
/// Timeline: 0–.05 the pulse strikes at the left · .02–.60 it crosses, drawing
/// the rule, igniting letters as it passes · .60–.72 it flares out · .66–1.0 the
/// rule retracts to a centred tick · rest, motionless.
