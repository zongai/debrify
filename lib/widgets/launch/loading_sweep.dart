/// Tiny fixed canvas + its own RepaintBoundary = a cheap per-frame raster even
/// on the weakest TV GPUs. [colors] come from the active launch ident so the
/// spinner belongs to whatever world the splash is set in.

/// TV contract: this one runs CONTINUOUSLY for as long as the splash holds, so
/// unlike the one-shot reveal painters every per-frame cost here repeats
/// indefinitely. Everything that survives a frame — shader, paints, geometry —
/// is built once per size; `paint` only rotates and draws. No saveLayer, no
/// blur, three draws a frame.
