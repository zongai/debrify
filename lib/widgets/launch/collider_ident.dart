/// Collider — two spiral galaxies fall together, shear each other into tidal
/// bridges, and merge in a white flash. The mark is forged out of the remnant,
/// and the blast front sweeping outward is what ignites the name: each letter
/// lights the instant the shockwave crosses it, hot, then cools into the ink.
///
/// The idea Horizon reaches for and this one commits to: nothing here is
/// decoration bolted onto a fade. The wordmark's cadence IS the shockwave's
/// geometry — letters near the centre light first because the front reaches
/// them first — so the type reads as a consequence of the collision instead of
/// a caption under it. [_maxR] is what makes that legible rather than merely
/// true; see the note there.

/// TV notes: stars are motion-streak line segments batched into four
/// drawRawPoints calls (one dim + one bright bucket per galaxy) over reused
/// Float32List buffers — 84 stars per galaxy on TV, 175 elsewhere; the only

/// pre-baked [_Ladder] built at layout, and every gradient that also MOVES or
/// GROWS is authored on the unit circle and placed by canvas transform — so
