/// The TV shell's GLASS STAGE: the Home board's focused title art, blurred,
/// filling the WHOLE screen — behind the tab content AND the sidebar rail
/// (the Home board's scaffold goes transparent over it). The "blur" is the
/// tiny-decode trick (decode at 96px, cover-stretch — bilinear upscale does
/// the softening): no BackdropFilter, no saveLayer, banned on TV anyway.
/// With a blurry background everywhere, every translucent panel above
/// (sidebar glass, chips, veils) reads as frosted glass for free.
///
/// Driven by [MainPageBridge.tvAmbientArt] + [MainPageBridge.tvHeroTint],
/// which the Home board publishes only on its 260ms focus-settle cadence —
/// this widget never rebuilds per keypress. Title changes crossfade 220ms
/// between two cached textures (no re-raster); tint settles rebuild the
/// washes in place (snap — the TV policy). Null art = the flat page ink,
/// which is also what every non-Home tab sits on. Android TV unmounts the art
/// outside Home, since even an opaque page becomes transparent during a fade.
