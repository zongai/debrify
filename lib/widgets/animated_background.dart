/// The app shell's backdrop: a static deep-indigo wash behind everything.
///
/// This used to animate on phone/tablet/desktop — a 12s gradient sweep, a 20s
/// particle drift painted with blurred circles, and a vignette — while TV took
/// a static early-return for performance. That motion is gone: the non-TV shell
/// Scaffold is now opaque page ink (see `main.dart`, `HomeTheme.bg`), because
/// letting the wallpaper show through the SafeArea strips left the status-bar
/// and home-indicator bands a different colour from the page. With the shell
/// opaque, nothing on any platform could see the animation — it was a
/// full-screen repaint per frame, with a MaskFilter blur, behind an opaque
/// surface, for the life of the app.
///
/// What remains is exactly what TV already rendered, so TV is unchanged. Kept
/// as a widget (rather than folded into the shell) so there's still one place
/// to put a backdrop back if a screen ever wants to be translucent again; the
/// animated version is in git history.
