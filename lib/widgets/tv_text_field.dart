/// Text field that is safe to use on TV.
///
/// On TV (with the Debrify keyboard enabled in Settings) the DPAD stop is a
/// SHELL: landing on it never opens any keyboard. OK begins editing — the
/// in-app [TvKeyboardPanel] appears and the remote navigates it; Back ends
/// editing and returns to the shell. The backing TextField keeps focus while
/// editing (real caret, and hardware/BT keyboards still type inline) but uses
/// [TextInputType.none], so the system IME — broken for DPAD on many TVs
/// (flutter/flutter#177360) — is never involved.
///
/// Off TV, or when the user opts out of the Debrify keyboard, this renders a
/// plain [TextField] with identical behavior to before the conversion.
