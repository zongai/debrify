///
/// * **`AppThemes.legacy`** — the compatibility profile. Every subprofile pins
///   the exact literal it replaces (`HomeTheme.focusGold`, `kSeeAllPanel`,
///   `kSettingsDim`, `CloudTheme.amber`, …), so a surface reading tokens under
///   `legacy` renders byte-for-byte what it rendered reading the constants.
///   Pinned by `test/theme/legacy_pins_test.dart` — if a constant and its pin
///   drift apart, that test fails, not a user's screen.
/// * **`AppTheme.fromDetail(core)`** — a real theme. Subprofiles are DERIVED
///   from the 20-theme detail core by the rules below. These derivations are
///   Foundation defaults: sweeps may refine them, but only by editing this
///   file (the no-agent-adds-a-token rule).

/// amber under legacy Cloud but are separate tokens on purpose — a theme must
/// be able to change one without misclassifying the other.

/// * **Distinctness.** An earlier version spanned the theme's
///   accent/callout/state, which collapses to ONE colour on every theme that
///   deliberately sets those equal — Broadsheet's single oxblood, and it is
///   far from alone. So the ramp varies lightness on a fixed scale instead,
///   which is also truer to legacy: its six "reds" are tones of one hue, not
///   six unrelated colours.
/// * **Legibility.** A single absolute lightness band cannot serve both
///   grounds: 0.34–0.74 reads well on ink and washes out to ~1.3:1 on paper,
///   where these tones carry dates and episode times. The band therefore
///   moves AWAY from the ground — bright on dark themes, deep on light ones.
