/// like GLES 2.0 lands on the full-resolution branch with no way off it. This
/// page is the way off it.
///
/// Automatic is not "off": the pref's ABSENCE is what keeps the device
/// decision alive, which is why [StorageService.setTvRenderQuality] removes
/// the key rather than writing `false`.

/// is reachable from Settings search like every other destination — people
