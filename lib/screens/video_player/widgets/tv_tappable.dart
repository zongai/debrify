/// A tap target that a remote can also reach.
///
/// The player's sheets were built for touch: rows are bare `GestureDetector`s,
/// which answer taps and nothing else, so on a television the DPAD had nowhere
/// to go and OK did nothing. This adds focus and keyboard/remote activation
/// around the same child.
///
/// Deliberately non-invasive so the touch layout is untouched:
/// * focus is only requestable on a television, so phones and desktop keep
///   exactly the traversal they have today;
/// * the focus ring is painted with `foregroundDecoration`, which draws OVER
///   the child instead of wrapping it — a border container would add insets and
///   shift every row.
